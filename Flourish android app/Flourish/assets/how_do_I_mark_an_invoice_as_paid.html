<div class="screensteps-image" style="margin: 20px 0;">
<p>Start by clicking on the “Sales” button on the “Navigation Bar”:<br /><img src="http://content.flourishapp.com/invoice1.png" alt="" /><br /><br /></p><p>This will take you to the “Invoice” page. Here you will find all of the invoices you have created in the past. Unpaid invoices will show the outstanding balance highlighted in red. When you are ready to mark the invoice as paid use the “Actions” menu and select “View”:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong><span class="caps">TIP</span>:</strong> You can also view the invoice by clicking on the invoice number to the left of the customers name.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img src="http://content.flourishapp.com/payinvoice1.png" alt="" /><br /><br /></p><p>You will now be taken to the selected invoice. To mark the invoice as paid click the “Add Payment” button on the top right side of the page:</p><img src="http://content.flourishapp.com/payinvoice2.png" alt="" /><p> </p><p>You will now see the “Add Payment” window where you can fill out all of the payment information fields. Once all information is entered click the “Save” button in the bottom right corner of the window.</p><p>The Flourish application is fully capable of understanding partial payments. For example this was a $15.00 invoice, however the customer has only paid $7.00 at this time. Simply enter the exact amount they have paid and the Flourish application will calculate the remaining balance:</p><p><img src="http://content.flourishapp.com/payinvoice3.png" alt="" /><br /><br /></p><p>You can now see that the status in the upper lefthand corner of the invoice has changed from “Unpaid” to “Partial Paid”:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong><span class="caps">TIP</span>:</strong> The status will change to “Paid” when the full balance of the invoice has been paid.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img src="http://content.flourishapp.com/payinvoice4.png" alt="" /><br /><br /></p><p>When you return to the “Invoices” page you can see that the outstanding balance has changed from $15.00 to $8.00. Once the remaining $8.00 balance is paid the “Outstanding” column will read $0.00 and the red highlight will be removed:</p><p><img src="http://content.flourishapp.com/payinvoice5.png" alt="" /><br /><br /></p>
